# Gobber

Gobber provides a framework for creating and executing jobs. 

## TODO

- [x] Create queue base for basic queue work
- [ ] Start with a basic example of a single queue system with single worker
- [ ] From the above, define interfaces of how to interface with the framework
    - How do we define producers?
    - How do we define consumers?

## Questions
- [ ] Queue implementations and similar aren't really core to this. Should we move that out to separate repo?
